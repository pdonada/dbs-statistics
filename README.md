****************************************************************************
Guideline:
•	Use R/Rstudio or Python to develop your app. 

Task: Development of Statistical Analytics App
****************************************************************************
Instruction:

 The main task here is to create an app which suits for Statistics and data analytics. It means that the app should allow you to do some descriptive or predictive analytics on a real dataset. 
Your  App can be designed in the following way:
•	Import the data into app. Equivalently, In-built dataset might be used for analytics. 
•	Apply some descriptive analytics techniques on the dataset and visualize the quick insights. 
•	Apply at least one probabilistic model e.g. discrete or continuous probability models on the dataset and visualize the insight. 
•	Implement at least one hypothesis testing context and print out the decision in the shiny dashboard.
•	Apply at least one type of GLMs e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression on the dataset and visualize the model performance using an appropriate graph, e.g. ROC, performance plot, etc.  
•	Visualize the deep insight in dashboard environment. 

Your app will be assessed on the following items:
1-	The kernels of app; i.e. the main functions/algorithms which have been used in the App.   [40 marks]
2-	The code of UI and server parts along with the description.   [30 marks]
3-	Workability and flexibility of the app.   [30 marks]
